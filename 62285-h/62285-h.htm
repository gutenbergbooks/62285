<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>The autobiographical information about Mr. Clark Field,
which appears at the <a href="#c79">end of this brochure</a>, briefly tells the
inspiring story of well over four decades of dedication to&mdash;and
sincere belief in&mdash;the American Indian as a creative
artist. The results of these many years of collecting
Indian baskets (and pottery) are on permanent display
at Philbrook Art Center, in the Clark Field Collection; in
addition, many other specimens are in storage and available
to the scholar in the study collection. This brochure
is not intended as a catalogue of all of the baskets in the
Clark Field Collection, which includes more than a thousand
specimens. Rather, it serves as an introduction to
Indian basketry and tells the story of how baskets were
made and used. About 90 of the more important baskets
are illustrated, including the most famous American Indian
basket, woven by Dotsolalee reproduced in color
on the <a href="#cover">cover</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Field has combined his enthusiasm for the art of
Indian basketry with a high degree of scientific scholarship.
He has kept careful records, which will become
increasingly valuable as old specimens become even more
rare and this Indian skill gradually dies out in this modern
world. His daughter, Dorothy Field Maxwell, has assisted
Mr. and Mrs. Field in their collection and with the preparation
of this brochure. Mrs. Jeanne Snodgrass, Curator
of Indian Art at Philbrook, has also assisted with the
brochure in an editorial capacity.</p>
<p>Mr. Field has performed an invaluable service to
humanity in his long dedication to the preservation of
this most important facet of the original Americans, and
Philbrook Art Center will be, for countless generations,
a mecca for those who wish to enjoy this fascinating utilitarian,
yet esthetically meaningful art form.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">BASKETRY</span></h2>
<p>The need for food containers in early human communities
led to the &ldquo;invention&rdquo; of basketry. The first
baskets may have been made of animal skin or twigs;
but soon evolved into the use of more suitable materials
such as vegetable fibres. Because of the organic materials
used in making baskets, most of the earliest examples
have been lost through decay. A few examples have been
preserved but only in areas of extremely dry climate,
such as in Egypt, in Chile and Peru in South America, and
in the southwestern United States. Radiocarbon tests of
woven artifacts establish the existence and the use of
baskets in Nevada, Utah and Oregon as early as 9000 to
700 B.C., and that Egyptians of the pre-dynastic period
(c. 5000 B.C.) used baskets. Early literary sources, such
as the Bible, mention baskets and other woven articles such
as the &ldquo;ark of bulrushes&rdquo; in which the infant Moses was
hidden (Exod. 2: 3, 53); baskets were used to bring the
tithes to the temple, and Matthew talked of &ldquo;twelve
baskets full.&rdquo; (Matt. 14: 20.)</p>
<p>In the study of American Indian baskets there are
three major factors to be considered: the first is the tribe
which produced the basket; the second is the language,
since inter-marriage among tribes produced varying cultures;
the third factor is the weave of the basket itself.
For example, the five major weaves used by American
Indians are: Coil, Twine, Twill, Wicker and Imbricated.
To the novice there is the obvious difference in shape,
color and texture of a collection of Indian baskets viewed
in a museum. To the collector there is the hint of the whole
pattern of life of the Indians who produced the basket.</p>
<p>The materials used in any particular basket reflect the
locale of the tribe which produced it, for the Indian used
materials that were at hand. In the case of the <i>Cherokees</i>,
a native variety of red honey suckle produced runners that
were used by that tribe in Virginia in a wicker-type weave.
In North Carolina, the same tribe utilized the Japanese
honeysuckle, while in Oklahoma the tribe used buckbrush
runners. In Arizona, the <i>Pimas</i> wove split willow twigs
and the black Martyna or &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Claw&rdquo; of their desert
lands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>It is the Indian woman, not the man, who makes baskets
(except for few instances, i.e., the <i>Papago</i> carrying basket).
They are made either for utilitarian use or for ceremonial
use. Basket designs are not taught to the craftsman nor
are they copied from a pattern book. They are created
by the individual weaver who is an artist of great ability.
The artist-craftsman must first develop a manner of weaving
that will form a shape adequate for the basket&rsquo;s final
use. She must then find suitable materials in her area for
this weaving project. This step completed, she mentally
creates a decorative design and invents a method of
weaving it into the basket.</p>
<p>It is known that all North American Indian tribes, at
some time in their history, made and used baskets. However,
the finest and most decorative baskets were made
about the middle of the 19th century, in the Northwest,
down the Pacific Coast states and into the Southwest
through Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>In 1935 there were more than five hundred <i>Pima</i> Indians making baskets for their own use. Now there are
less than six good weavers on that reservation. Today
<i>Papago</i> Indians make some baskets for tourist trade, but
not nearly as many as they made a few years ago. The
<i>Hopi</i> Indians bring a few baskets to market places, but
there are fewer and fewer each year. For example: at the
1964 Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonials, Gallup, New Mexico,
there were forty classifications in the basketry competition&mdash;baskets
were submitted to only twenty-seven
classifications. There are some basket weavers among
other tribes but for the most part, few tribes today may
be called &ldquo;basket makers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The influence of other culture groups upon the craft
of basket weaving is so great that each year fewer baskets
are produced by the regular weavers. The Indian women
have learned that they can secure mass produced articles
as a substitute for baskets. Only two percent of the types
of baskets included in this collection are now being made.
It is quite probable that by the year 2000 there will be
NO Indian baskets being woven.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">EARLY BASKETRY</span></h2>
<h3 id="c4"><i>Ozark Mountains of Arkansas</i></h3>
<p>Very few people are aware that baskets were made by
the Ozark &ldquo;Bluff Dwellers.&rdquo; A special exhibit in the University
of Arkansas Museum, Fayetteville, contains a small
basket filled with grasshoppers. The University Museum
points out that as long ago as the year 1 A.D., baskets
were being made by Indians in the Ozark Area. This
provides further evidence of the Indian&rsquo;s early inhabitance
of this country.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">BASKETS WHICH ARE NO LONGER MADE&mdash;AND WHY</span></h2>
<p>Case No. 5:</p>
<p>These tightly woven baskets made by <i>Thlinkits</i> of
Alaska, were woven from spruce tree roots which were
split by hand. The baskets were used to hold boiling
water for clam cooking. The fibers swelled to such
an extent that water could be retained in the basket for
as long as five hours. Today this tribe purchases a kettle
or bucket for their boiling needs.
<span class="lr">(See <a class="htm" href="#fig9c">Plate 9c</a>)</span></p>
<p>Case No. 7:</p>
<p>These large <i>Apache</i> baskets used for storing grain,
were made about 1874. It required as long as three
months to produce this type of specimen and since 1914
very few have been made. The twenty-five cent burlap
sack has replaced it.
<span class="lr">(See <a class="htm" href="#fig6c">Plate 6c</a>)</span></p>
<p>Case No. 9:</p>
<p>This <i>Cochiti</i> bird cage, made of a yucca plant, has
been replaced by metal bird cages.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">IDEAS COPIED FROM INDIAN BASKETS</span></h2>
<p>The Anglo appropriated many Indian basket ideas for
his own use:</p>
<p>The <i>Penobscot</i> colander was found in use as such
among the people of this Maine tribe and was made about
1841. It is quite possible that we took this as a pattern
for our own metal colanders.
<span class="lr">(See <a class="htm" href="#fig10a">Plate 10a</a>)</span></p>
<p>It is also quite possible that we copied the pattern of

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">THE VANISHING INDIAN?</span></h2>
<p>The vanishing Indian? He is not vanishing! In 1890,
the Indian population in North America numbered about
one quarter million and in 1963, records reveal there are
over one million Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">SYMBOLIC DESIGNS?</span></h2>
<p>There is the mistaken idea that one tribe &ldquo;understands&rdquo;
the designs of another tribe and that there is symbolism,
or meaning, to every design. Actually, <i>most</i> designs are
purely decorative renderings and they have no more symbolism
for the Indian than a fabric design has for the general
public.</p>
<p>The identification of a basket is made not through the
interpretation of a &ldquo;mysterious meaning&rdquo; of the design
but generally from the design motif itself. For instance,
baskets made by tribes of southern California are distinguishable
to the trained eye since they tend to be of
a particularly heavy, bold and angular style. They seldom
have <i>mysterious meanings</i>!
<span class="lr">(See <a class="htm" href="#fig12b">Plate 12b</a>)</span></p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">BASKETRY</span></h2>
<h3 id="c11"><i>Western Apache</i>&mdash;Arizona and New Mexico</h3>
<p>Case No. 13:</p>
<p>At one time it was not difficult to identify <i>Apache</i>
Basketry by tribal name, such as: <i>San Carlos</i>, <i>Chiricahua</i>,
<i>Tonto</i>, and <i>Yavapai</i>. Today it is not possible to identify
baskets as belonging to a particular <i>Apache</i> tribe.</p>
<p>During the nineteenth century these southwest tribes
waged continual warfare with the Anglos and Spaniards
who had settled in the area. Attempts were made by the
United States government to establish treaties. However,
newly written treaties were broken before the ink dried!
About 1880, the army rounded up all the Apaches of
Arizona and New Mexico and took them as prisoners to
the <i>San Carlos Reservation</i>. There they remained confined
for several years. During this period of confinement
the basket weavers copied designs and weaving techniques
from one another.</p>
<p>When the tribes were released and allowed to return
to their respective reservations the &ldquo;new&rdquo; styles of basketry
were continued. As a result of this situation, today we
find baskets woven by these tribes to be so similar in
appearance that definite tribal affiliation cannot be determined.
They are therefore classified only as <i>Western
Apache</i> baskets.

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">DATSOLALEE</span>
<br />1918
<br /><i>Washoe</i>&mdash;Western Nevada</h2>
<p>Case No. 3:</p>
<p>This basket was made by <i>Dabuda</i> (Young Willow).
She was later given the nick-name of <i>Datsolalee</i> (Broad
in the Hips) and is best known by this name since later
in life she tipped the scales at 350 pounds.</p>
<p>On March 26, 1917, <i>Datsolalee</i> started weaving this
specimen which is fifty-two inches in circumference and
has more than 100,000 stitches (more than thirty to the
inch). Eleven months later, on February 16, 1918, she
completed this basket which is her greatest masterpiece.
Although made for ceremonial use, the shape is that of
a food bowl. The white background is made of peeled
twig from the Mountain Willow; the black color is the
root of a Bracken, or giant fern; the reddish-brown is bark
from the Nevada Redbud. To her the design meant: <i>We
assemble to discuss the happy lives of our ancestors.</i>
Shortly after the completion of this basket the weaver lost
her eyesight. She died at the age of 95 in 1926.</p>
<p>In 1958 the U. S. Indian Arts and Crafts Board,
Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., rated this
basket as probably the finest specimen of basketry ever
produced.</p>
<p>During her lifetime, <i>Datsolalee</i> made only forty-six
large scale baskets. During the summer months she could
often be found at the resort area of Lake Tahoe, California,
weaving miniature basketry which she sold to tourists for
small sums. In 1914, Mrs. Henrietta K. Burton, from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C., visited the
artist&rsquo;s home in Carson City, Nevada. Mrs. Burton made
numerous photographs of <i>Datsolalee</i> and her baskets for
use in federal publications which dealt with Indian basketry.
Since that time these photos have appeared in many
other basketry publications.</p>
<p>Due to the artist&rsquo;s reputation and ability, as well as
the artistry and craftsmanship of this specimen it is valued
at $2000. It is doubtful such a basket could ever again
be produced&mdash;no weaver today shows ability such as
that of <i>Datsolalee</i>. Her baskets are sought by collectors
throughout the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>In 1914, G. A. Steiner, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
purchased the finest basket the artist had produced up
to that time. It is forty-nine inches in circumference and
has more than eighty thousand stitches. It was purchased
for $1950, and added to the Carnegie Library Collection
in Pittsburgh (this was the highest price ever paid for
a single Indian basket).</p>
<p>Philbrook&rsquo;s <i>Datsolalee</i> basket has received international
recognition. It may be seen, in color, in <i>Indian Art
in America</i>, by Frederick J. Dockstader (New York
Graphic Society, 1960) and in the magazine <i>America</i>
(No. 67) which was distributed by the U. S. Information
Agency and printed in Russian.

<p>Between dances the basket is used for storing the

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">MORTUARY</span>
<br /><i>Pomo</i>&mdash;Northern California</h2>
<p>Case No. 3:</p>
<p>The <i>Pomo</i> Indians are the only tribe known to have
completely and fully decorated baskets with feathers.
These baskets were considered to be the tribe&rsquo;s highest artistic
achievement. It was a great honor to the memory of a
deceased person when this type of basket, especially made
for such an occasion, was placed on his body at the cremation
ceremony. It may be said that the sacrifice of
these baskets was the tribe&rsquo;s most profound means of
showing respect at the time of cremation.</p>
<p>The custom of making and using these baskets no
longer prevails. Few people today know the art, and
even fewer people are willing to devote the nearly two
years to make one feathered basket.</p>
<p>At the time this ceremony was active in the <i>Pomo</i>
culture, each family had several such baskets in reserve.
It must therefore be assumed that the women of the
tribe devoted a great deal of their time producing these
symbols to honor the dead.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare cultures: The <i>Pomo</i> Indian
sacrificed a work of art which took about two years
to make&mdash;today&rsquo;s Anglo society calls the florist and orders
a &ldquo;ten dollar spray&rdquo; of flowers. This basket on the collector&rsquo;s
market is valued at about $300.

<br /><i>Hoopa</i>&mdash;California</h2>
<p>Case No. 4:</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Jumping Dance Basket&rdquo; receives its name from
a ceremony in which the participants perform with jumping
dance motions. This ceremony is a prayer of supplication
for the return of the soil&rsquo;s fertility. It is held in the
spring of the year on land that has ceased to bear crops.</p>
<p>Some people question these customs, and actually call
them mere &ldquo;Indian superstitions.&rdquo; It is revealing to note,
however, that less than a century ago Anglos believed
that the childhood disease, rickets, could be cured by
splitting an ash tree at dawn, and passing the stricken
child head-first through the opening in the tree.</p>
<p>This set of three baskets, handed down from generation
to generation, was secured from a medicine man. The
baskets were made prior to 1860 and no one living today
seems to know how to weave them. As a result, the baskets
are quite rare, and it is doubtful if another such set could
be obtained.

is part of a boy&rsquo;s initiation ceremony at puberty.
The ceremony is held mainly in the <i>Kiva</i> (underground
ceremonial chamber), from December through April. Here
the novice meets his godfather for the first time.</p>
<p>The design of the large plaque (at top of plate) represents
a sand painting which is executed on the floor
before the <i>Kiva</i> altar. The novice wears only a breechcloth
as his godfather instructs him to kneel on the painting
and rubs him with sacred corn meal, which has been
blessed by the <i>Cacique</i> or religious leader. The significance
of this ritual is that the novice&rsquo;s sins and evil thoughts are
washed away. The corn meal is then taken outside and
cast to the winds, thus purifying the boy. (Center of <a class="htm" href="#fig20">plate 20</a>:

<p>The wicker basket (at bottom of <a class="htm" href="#fig20">plate 20</a>) is used in
carrying bean sprouts and young corn during the &ldquo;February

<p>This plaque is made of yucca. The green color is unbleached
yucca, the white is bleached yucca and the black
color is yucca which has been dyed by using black sunflower
seeds.</p>
<p>The plaque is called <i>Kochaiinpi</i> (White Meal Plaque),
and is woven by a prospective bride for use in the wedding
procession. It is hung in the newly married couple&rsquo;s
home afterwards, partly to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>After the wedding the single-file procession proceeds
to the new home which has recently been built by
the groom. This procession is led by the bride&rsquo;s mother
who carries on her head a large pottery bowl filled with
baked beans. The bride follows next. With both hands
she carries a large basket tray stacked with the <i>piki</i> bread
(a thin wafer of bread&mdash;almost like parchment) which
she has made from blue corn meal mixed with sweetened
siovi ashes and cooked on a hot stone. Next in line are
four male relatives of the bridegroom, each holding a corner
of a blanket on which rests the &ldquo;White Meal Plaque.&rdquo;
The plaque filled and running over with the white meal
which the bride had ground earlier. Thus, the young
couple start their life together with an ample quantity
of food.</p>
<p>The spiritual connotation of the basket is this: It is
believed that at the time of death an individual&rsquo;s soul
stands on the brink of the <i>Maski</i> (or after world; in this
case literally the Grand Canyon). The soul steps onto the
&ldquo;White Meal Plaque,&rdquo; gently soars over the abyss, and
safely descends to the bottom. Thus the soul departs to
the abiding place of the dead and forever rests in peace.

about two hundred quail. The feathers which protrude
from the basket, are from the head of the Valley Quail,
or Gambel&rsquo;s Quail. The dark blue feathers are taken from
different quails. The decorative disk-like beads are fashioned
in the following manner: the shells are broken into
small pieces and then drilled with a pump drill. They
are then strung on a cord and the strand is then rubbed
on a wet sandstone until the beads are round and uniform
in size.</p>
<p>This type of basket was made by the bride&rsquo;s mother and
is considered to be the finest example of basketry produced
by <i>Pomo</i> Indians. The <i>Chimopika</i> (Dowry Basket)
is presented to the bridegroom, by the weaver, at the
wedding ceremony. Sweetmeats, such as cakes of sugar from
sugar sap trees, are placed in the basket and passed around
to the guests.</p>
<p>The married couple retains this sacred memento of
the marriage ceremony as long as they both live, but if
either of the couple dies the basket is sacrificed in the
cremation ceremony.</p>
<p>This basket was used in ceremonies prior to about
1889. They are no longer made or used. This basket was

<p>Evidence of the importance of basketry among the

<p>Case No. 7:</p>
<p>This unusually large specimen is almost three feet tall.
Since about 1914, very few, if any, as large as this have
been made. An Indian woman would have to devote three
to four months to the weaving of a basket of this size.
Today she can purchase a gunny sack from the nearest
trading post for twenty five cents and store the same
amount of grain with much less effort.</p>
<p>This basket, valued at $750.00 on the collector&rsquo;s market
today, is a splendid illustration of a dying art. The
forthcoming Indian generation will not be concerned with
the making of baskets for daily use. The beautiful weaving
techniques and colorful designs will become a thing of

<p>This carrying, or burden, basket, referred to by <i>Papagos</i>
as <i>Kiaha</i>, is made of stems from the Cereus Giganteus
Cactus and the twine from leaves of the Maguey plant.
The Maguey plant played a major role in <i>Papago</i> life due

liquor were obtained from it.</p>
<p>The <i>Papagos</i> taught the Spaniards to make liquors
from the juice of the Maguey plant more than four hundred
years ago. The liquor is still made today in Mexico.</p>
<p>In 1540, the Spaniards, led by Coronado, arrived in

jars and corn were carried in this basket, which is equipped
with a head band and rests on the shoulders. After the
Spaniards introduced horses and horses became plentiful,

<h2 id="c42"><span class="small">PORCUPINE QUILL DECORATION</span>
<br />c. 1903
<br /><i>Chippewa</i>&mdash;Minnesota</h2>
<p>Case No. 2:</p>
<p>One of the finest examples of the Indian woman&rsquo;s
native creative arts is found in porcupine quill decoration.
The artist formerly prepared her own dyes from berries,
roots, barks, etc. Today, aniline dyes are used almost exclusively.
Steps used in the preparation of quills for bark
decoration are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The artist usually divides the quills into four
lengths and stores them in separate containers because
they differ in length and thickness (one to four
inches long and 1/16 to 3/32 inches thick). The
quills are washed well in soap root before being dyed,
and stored. When she is ready to use the quills she
softens them in her mouth. The warmth and moisture
are most effective and it is thought that the saliva
contains some special property that makes them more
pliable. She generally keeps a number of the quills
of the same size and color in one cheek with the
points protruding from her lips, pulling out a quill
as it is needed. Small holes are punched in the bark
with an awl and the quill is inserted in these holes.
The ends are bent over on the back side of the bark
to hold them in place. By using quills of the desired
length to fit the decoration, it is not necessary to cut
them. The quill swells and stiffens as it dries, making
it even more secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In most boxes, so decorated, a plain undecorated piece
of bark is fitted on the inside (or back side) to hide the
raw ends of the quills. Three to four thousand quills are
required to cover a box the size of the one shown in
<a class="htm" href="#fig1a">Plate 1a</a>. Vegetable dyes were used on the quills of this
box and have not faded in more than fifty years.

<h2 id="c44"><span class="small">MOOSE HAIR EMBROIDERY</span>
<br />c. 1875
<br /><i>Huron</i>&mdash;Province of Quebec, Canada</h2>
<p>Case No. 3:</p>
<p>This basket and the basket from Maine are rare examples
of the old Indian art of moose hair embroidery.
A cluster of very fine hair grows from the withers of the
wild moose and this hair, dyed in suitable colors, is used
for the embroidery.</p>
<p>The art of this type embroidery probably dates back
to about 1714, at which time the natives used this method
of decoration for their own buckskin clothing. It is believed
that these people were taught the art at convents
after the steel needle was introduced into this country
from Europe in the eighteenth century. However, there
is no proof of this theory.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note other unique examples of
decorative art by these people; i.e., the drilling of seed
pearls the size of the head of a straight pin and in turn,
sewing these pearls on cloth or fiber. With crude tools,
they created rare and beautiful works of decorative art
which would be difficult for us to duplicate with today&rsquo;s
precision tooling.</p>
<p>After adopting Anglo-style clothing these Indians practiced
moose hair embroidery art on trinkets such as these
until it became almost extinct by 1890. Specimens such
as these are rare even in museums.

<br /><i>Eskimo</i>&mdash;Point Barrow, Alaska</h2>
<p>Case No. 3:</p>
<p>The Baleen used in the weaving of this basket is found
in the upper jaw of the Bowhead, or Alaskan Right Whale.
This horny substance is pulled into various sized strips.
While it is still fresh it is flexible and can be woven as
easily as fiber. The same weaving technique used in making
coiled baskets from grass roots is also used in the
construction of this basket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>An Alaskan trader is credited with having taught the
<i>Eskimos</i> to use Baleen as a weaving medium. The art was
almost extinct until a few years ago when the U. S. Indian
Arts and Crafts Board gave needed encouragement to the
craftsmen.</p>
<p>The Bowhead, or Right Whale, is not plentiful at
Point Barrow; only two or three such whales are caught
during a good year. Some years none are caught.</p>
<p>Two factors are predominate in making this type of
basketry scarce: 1) lack of Baleen, 2) the fifty hours
necessary for a skillful craftsman to construct the specimen.</p>
<p>The decorative ivory figure on the lid of the basket
is made of walrus tusk.

<br /><i>Attu</i>&mdash;Attu Island, Alaska</h2>
<p>Case No. 6:</p>
<p>The baskets shown in display case no. 6, are the
finest weave known to have been made in North America.</p>
<p>Woven in about thirty days, the average size basket
may have up to 10,000 stitches to the square inch. The
finest machine made cotton sheeting has 3600 stitches
to the square inch.</p>
<p>The dark toned baskets were made about 1860 and the
lighter toned ones were made between 1939 and 1944.</p>
<p>These specimens are made by the <i>Aleut</i> Indian women
of a beach grass (Wild Rye) which grows on Attu Island.
The stems and blades are about the size of wheat straw,
and the <i>Aleut</i> women split them with their finger nails.</p>
<p>In 1741, Russian explorers discovered and settled the
Aleutian Islands. They later found that the native women
were wrapping their dead with finely woven, narrow
strips of grass fiber and placing the bodies in caves.</p>
<p>Russians then encouraged the <i>Aleuts</i> to weave baskets
of this same product. In the normal course of events,
the Russians influenced the use of silk and cotton thread
decorations on the baskets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>In 1948, Edward L. Keithan, curator of The State
Museum of Alaska, made a field trip to the Aleutian
Islands and found only three women still practicing this
fine art of basketry. Today, there is no continuance of
this art.

<span class="lr">(See <a class="htm" href="#fig4c">Plate 4c</a>)</span></p>
<p class="revint"><i>Cheyennes</i> of Oklahoma, used a basket bowl with wooden
counters.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Pawnees</i> of Nebraska, used a basket tray. This is the only
type of basketry known to have been made by them.
This basket was made before they were removed to
Oklahoma.
<span class="lr">(See <a class="htm" href="#fig4d">Plate 4d</a>)</span></p>
<p class="revint"><i>Klamaths</i> of Oregon, used a different gambling device in
that it was more of a guessing game. The mat covered
the hands of the operator. The two bones are held,
one in each hand, and rotated. The bet was made
on the turn of the selected bone. These counters were
usually made from the foreleg of a deer or elk.</p>
<p>The Mongolian culture is well known to have a strong
interest in gambling games. Some anthropologists tell us
that the North American Indians came to this country
many years ago across the Bering Sea from Asia and that
they are descendants of the Mongolians in that area.</p>

<h2 id="c49"><span class="small">MANIOC PRESS</span>
<br /><i>Carib</i>&mdash;Guatemala and Venezuela</h2>
<p>Case No. 13:</p>
<p>Indians of Mexico, Central America, northern South
America and the Caribbean Islands used this press to
remove poison (Hydrocyanic Acid) from the Manioc
root. This root is similar to the root used in the preparation
of tapioca. The Indians process the root to make
a flour which is used in a native bread. This type of
press was in use by these people as early as 892 A.D. and
in some areas is still being used today.</p>
<p>To remove the poison from Manioc the root is pounded,
then stuffed into the basket, causing it to expand in
girth and to shorten in length. (The particular type of
diagonal twill weave used in this basket press permits
a girth expansion to twice its former size and a reduction
in length of about one-half its original size.) The
press is then submerged in water and soaked until thoroughly
saturated. When it is removed from the water
the press is hung by the loop end, usually on a branch.
The foot or a weight is put on the closed end of the
press and this creates a squeezing action which removes
the poison from the root inside. At this point the press
changes shape and becomes long and narrow again. This
process is repeated several times to assure the removal
of the poison.

some basket making tribes: Hoopas, of California, used
a sit-down type cradle&mdash;the baby is seated in, and tied
to, the cradle; <i>Hopis</i>, of Arizona and <i>Frazier River</i>, of
Washington, used the cradle for putting the baby to
sleep holding the cradle in their arms; tribes such as
<i>Mono-Paiute</i> and <i>Pomo</i>, of California, and <i>Ute</i> of Colorado,
used the cradle by placing it on the mother&rsquo;s back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>There are more than six hundred Indian dialects. The
<i>Ute</i> word for cradle is <i>Ahcacon</i>. When asked, what the
Indian word for &ldquo;cradle,&rdquo; or &ldquo;baby board&rdquo; is, it is impossible
to answer. Because of the many dialects it is
easily understandable that there are numerous words for
this object, just as the word would be different in Spanish,
Swedish, German or Russian.

<h2 id="c51"><span class="small">BLOW GUN AND QUIVER</span>
<br /><i>Cherokee</i>&mdash;North Carolina.</h2>
<p>Case No. 1:</p>
<p>Made of wild cane and six feet long, this type blow
gun was used for shooting poison darts. Some guns are
as long as twenty feet. A blow gun is extraordinary in that
it has for example, the power to shoot a dart a quarter of
an inch into a pine door. This power is probably due to
the choke bore design of the gun.</p>
<p>The darts are fifteen to eighteen inches long and are
made of locust wood. They are sharpened and hardened
over a flame at one end and, at the opposite end are
wrapped at an angle with the silk from a thistle plant.
As the air is blown into the gun the thistle silk fluffs and
creates a shoulder to blow against. The dart is retarded in
its movement by the taper of the bore. It is not known
what implement was employed to produce this tapered
bore.</p>
<p>Many years ago this type blow gun, with poison darts,
was used in warfare by the <i>Cherokee</i>, <i>Choctaw</i>, <i>Catawaba</i>,
and <i>Houma</i> tribes. Displayed with the blow gun and darts
is the basket quiver which held the darts. These specimens
were brought to Oklahoma before 1860, by the grandfather
of Jim Backwater.

<blockquote>
<p>The Clark Field Collection of Indian Baskets is composed
of one thousand and ninety six specimens, as of date
(1964), from throughout North America and represents
almost every basket making tribe of that area. Due to the
wide scope of tribal representation and the beauty of these
outstanding specimens, this collection is rated by the
U. S. Indian Arts and Crafts Board as the most outstanding
Indian basket collection in North America.</p>

<h2 id="c74"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>The purpose that a foreword serves to the reading public is ostensibly to
express its writer&rsquo;s endorsement of the material presented and of the mode
of treatment. In this instance the purpose is heartily avowed. The monograph
in hand forms a contribution to the series of studies being pursued
widely among scholars whose aim is to piece together portions of the picture
of culture of the Indians of the Southeast. Our knowledge of the culture
properties of native tribes in any area where their development has been
going on for centuries in their original seats comes necessarily by gradual
steps. These may seem disconnected in the minds of laymen who are in
haste to see the whole story completed. Perhaps only the pioneer investigator
knows how long and intimately a people must be studied by dwelling
in their midst before their ways of life become clear enough to be understood
and discussed. Collections of data, historical, descriptive and functional,
have to be made and preserved in the form of notes and actual
specimens. When these ends are accomplished, the picture of tribal life takes
definite shape, and another gap in the history of a people is closed. These
are the requirements for carrying on in a somewhat new undertaking in the
line of history, namely ethno-history.</p>
<p>Studies of a people&rsquo;s physical structure, their psychology, language, religion
and government contribute their share. On the material side their crafts
developed to supply economic needs and the art involved in the crafts themselves
must be illustrated with accumulations of specimens. These requirements
the author of the following study has had well in mind for a considerable
space of time, and he has treated them with conservative judgment and
a regard for their implications with botany and ecology. Such remarks applied
to the paper constitute the ethnologist&rsquo;s endorsement.</p>
<p>It is a splendid thing for man of the present to take time to stabilize his mind
to contemplating the achievements of tribes inhabiting our continent as a
prologue to the affairs of the present. Where is the brash critic to persist in
the claim that the natives of America have no original elements of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo;
either from the early or late past, or in the present? The Cherokee have
provided an answer. Contemporary literature has amassed the evidence nor
alone in the series of volumes from the University of Oklahoma Press, but in
prose and poetry known throughout the nation. It offers a compendious
chapter in the epic of America. Each additional study adds a paragraph of
importance to the whole.</p>
<p>The study to follow contributes a detail of existing knowledge of the art-crafts
of the Cherokee. As such it will prove to be another source reference
to the Cherokee way of life in art and its expression in concrete form. The
utilities have been and still are to Indians a means of finding outlet for their
aesthetic urges. Art and crafts are merged in the output. Other fields lie
open for further attempts to perform its functions in national life by issuing
successive publications dealing with its cultural material, thus laying foundations
for that basic teaching we fondly call Americanism.</p>

<h2 id="c75"><span class="small">ROOT RUNNER BASKETRY</span></h2>
<p>The association of root-runner basket forms in America would show a number
of instances of use of a &ldquo;Rod&rdquo; as a one rod foundation for coiled baskets
occurring originally in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and on the plains.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
This technologically simple form of basket building material has implications
bearing upon the age and area theory that challenges attention on a wider
scale. Apart from the coiling process, a single rod construction appears in the
Southeast in wicker work. What conclusions a broader study of single rod
basketry (to which class the root runner series belongs) in any of its constructional
forms, whether in coiling or wicker work, would lead to is quite
beyond the purpose of this article.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the writer to record a simple phase of basketry technique in
the southern middle Atlantic slope and the northern part of the south and
southeast area, as it applies to the Cherokee of the North Carolina highlands
and of Oklahoma. In these areal habitats the two subdivisions of the tribe
make use of three diverse plant types, the use of which in basketry construction
in some districts does not overlap or coincide. In Carolina an earlier
root-runner style has either passed out of memory or never existed among the
Cherokee Indians, but came in later through acculturative changes. As far as
has been ascertained, all fine root runner fibers used in the making of Indian
baskets belong to two family groups, the botanical names of which are Caprifoliceae
and Crataegus.</p>
<p>To the first family group belong:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Japanese Honeysuckle (Lonicera Japonica)</dt>
<dt>A vine introduced into America from Asia around 1906.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></dt>
<dt>Buckbrush (Symphoricarpos Orbiculatus)</dt>
<dt>Also called Indian Currant and Coral Berry.</dt></dl>
<p>To the second family belong:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Wild Hawthorne (Crataegus Crus Galli)</dt>
<dt>The Yuki Indians of California made a basket out of the stems of a native honeysuckle (Lonicera Interrupta). It, however does not have fine root runners.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></dt></dl>

</div>
<p>The Rappahannock Indians of Virginia
make a basket of Japanese honeysuckle
root runners of a wicker type
weave which is crude in weaving
technique in comparison with baskets
from North Carolina. (Rappahannock
of Virginia.) Quoting Dr. Speck, &ldquo;The
art was revived by some of the women
in 1922, when the Indian Association
was formed. Susie and Lizzie Nelson,
old Bob Nelson and other Rappahannock
Indians made these baskets at
that time. Chief Otto Nelson, his wife Susie, and Lizzie Nelson remember
that when they were young about 1890, their grandmother Sallie Ronnie,
who was then about 60 years old, had a honeysuckle sewing basket shaped
like an oval bowl, similar in weave to the baskets mentioned above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a native local, variety of Red Honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervirens)
in Virginia which is not a ground runner but clings for six feet or so to
trees and fences; it is finer stemmed than the Japanese variety and Indian
women of the Rappahannock tribe have agreed to weave with it. All honeysuckle
runners are kept soaked in water to preserve their pliability for
weaving. They can be gathered and woven at any time of the year if treated
in this manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as known no other fine root runner is used for basket weaving by the
Indians of this state, although other fine root runners such as Devil&rsquo;s Shoestring
and London Pride grow there. Comments on honeysuckle wicker-weave
baskets among the Mattaponi Indians of Virginia are made by Dr.
Frank Speck in his book &ldquo;At Mattaponi,&rdquo; in which he speaks of the girls
making baskets of honeysuckle stems, meticulously neat and with a technique
suspiciously European in detail. We cannot be too sure that something like
this did not exist before as many references to baskets of various forms
made in the early days are encountered.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> The Pamunkey Tribe, living on
a reservation ten miles south of Mattaponi, have used honeysuckle runners
for over twenty years. In both bands the details of form and weave are
identical, and the historical circumstances may also be.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12a.jpg" alt="Root Runner Basket" width="470" height="240" />
</div>
<p>The Cherokee Indians of North Carolina
used Japanese honeysuckle in basket
weaving as early as 1880, when it
was introduced by a Cherokee woman
named Arizona Blankenship who had
been educated at Hampton Institute,
Virginia. It is interesting to note that
the Cherokee Agency Indian School
was founded at Cherokee, North Carolina,
that same year.</p>
<p>In January, 1943, Dr. Speck made an extensive trip into the hill country
around Cherokee, North Carolina, visiting the old conservative Cherokee
Indians of that region. He learned from the old people that honeysuckle
basket weaving was not an original Cherokee Indian art. Making inquiry
into their history of basket weaving, he could find no evidence of their use
of hawthorne (Crataegus) although it is native to that state, or any historical
evidence of the use of any other fine root runners. It is possible, of
course, that the Hawthorne runners could have been used by other Indian
bands in other parts of the state but so far it is not known, notwithstanding
the fact Dr. Speck has spent many years of study of Cherokee Indian basketry
in North Carolina.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> Cane and oak splints were used chiefly by the Cherokee
in basket weaving and the use of Japanese honeysuckle was undoubtedly a
later addition to their culture. An illustration of one of the earliest known
types of honeysuckle weave is shown in the Cherokee of North Carolina
plate. This basket has no foundation to support the fine root runner fibers
although most of their baskets made of honeysuckle runners do have
foundations of oak splints. As far as is known no double weaving of fine
root runner baskets was done by the Cherokee of this state.</p>

</div>
<p>The Cherokee of Oklahoma used buckbrush
(Symphoricarpos Orbiculatus)
in making fine root runner baskets and
it appears after careful study and extensive
inquiry, that this type of basket
weaving may have originated
among the Indians of Oklahoma. This
conclusion is based on many years of
collecting baskets from Cherokee Indians
in every part of the old Cherokee
nation. Interviews with older basket-making
women were held through interpreters
and it was clearly established
that basket making from honeysuckle
was not known to them or to their mothers or grandmothers who had lived
in Georgia and North Carolina before their removal in 1938 to Oklahoma.
The only type of weaving known to them before coming to Oklahoma was
the cane and oak-splint weaving. From such interviews these facts could be
traced back to as early as 1850. They were certain that the earliest baskets
made by their grandparents were out of buckbrush and oak splints; no cane
or honeysuckle was used in the northern part of the Cherokee nation.</p>
<p>In the Spavinaw hills country of the northern part of the Cherokee nation
the Indians used only buckbrush runners as cane does not grow in this section.
In the southern part of the nation, in the vicinity of Gore and Weber
Falls, cane grows and is used almost exclusively in basket weaving. In the
locality of Tahlequah and Stillwell both cane and buckbrush weaving is done.
The Cherokee of this region make both a double and single wicker weave
basket of buckbrush runners and no foundation is used in either type although
each is strong and serviceable. All of their fine root runner baskets
(buckbrush) are a wicker type of weave of unexcelled technique. The
double weave basket made by Lucy Mouse (shown in the Oklahoma example)
is a splendid specimen of fine weaving&mdash;a strong durable basket.
The dye used in this basket is walnut stain from boiled walnut hulls.</p>
<p>The buckbrush runners are pulled in the fall of the years and after drying
two or three weeks are boiled to remove the bark. The fibers remain flexible
enough for weaving all winter which is the basket weaving season.</p>
<p>The shapes were formerly market baskets, fruit trays, egg baskets and storage
baskets, some of which were used by them as long as fifty years ago. Twenty-five
years ago vegetable dyes were used for coloring but today commercial
dyes are largely used; the baskets are made, as a rule, for sale, and show
considerable white influence.</p>

<h2 id="c79"><span class="small">AUTOBIOGRAPHY</span></h2>
<p>I was born in Dallas, Texas, on January 6, 1882.</p>
<p>I first became interested in the art work of the Indians
while working as a reporter for an Oklahoma daily
newspaper in 1900, at which time I covered the opening
for settlement of the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Indian
reservations in southwest Oklahoma. After two years
of study (1903-1904) at the University of Oklahoma,
I became a traveling salesman and remained in that profession
until 1917 when I went into business for myself
(retired from business in 1957). About 1918 I became
actively interested in Indian pottery and basketry
and started my collections. Since that time, Mrs. Field,
my daughter Dorothy Field Maxwell (Mrs. Gilbert S.),
and I have traveled more than one hundred and twenty
five thousand miles collecting in the United States, Canada,
Alaska, Mexico, Central and South America.</p>
<p>To date (1964) we have spent 46 years in trying to
collect authentic specimens of baskets made for actual
use by all basket-making tribes (no tourist specimens
are included). Intent upon maintaining the highest possible
quality throughout the collection, I have always
insisted upon acquiring the finest representative basket
for its particular tribe or use.</p>
<p>The collection is completely catalogued and photographed
and has been given to the Philbrook Art Center
of Tulsa, Oklahoma, where it is on exhibition. The collection
has been rated by members of the Indian Arts
and Crafts Board, and by members of other museums, as
the most comprehensive in the United States for its
beauty of specimens and unusual method of display.</p>
